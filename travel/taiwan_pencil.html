                I hope you enjoy the pineapple cakes from trip in Taiwan! I'm providing a bit more information about them if you were curious! 
                (A bit more about where they're from and interesting stories.) 
                Please enjoy with some tea or coffee as it can be a touch sweet. Also some more information on the included pencil!

                    This is the extremely well known version of the pineapple cake from Taiwan. Chia Te bakery does the original recipe very well and has a well deserved reputation. 
                    The bakery makes a variety of these pineapple cakes from the original (shown here), cherry pineapple, longan, pineapple and egg yolk amongst others.  
                    The original variant of the "pineapple cake" also includes wax gourd. You might have seen it during Lunar New Years when it's candied. This was done because 
                    back in the day the canning and processing of pineapple caused the pastries to taste bad. Sugar and wax gourd were introduced to make it more palatable.

                    You can only get these in specific locations and primarily at their 1 bakery store in Taipei. I, however, ended my trip on a holiday weekend so when 
                    I managed to make my way over there, they were closed. Thankfully they had the originals available at a nearby store knowing idiots like me trying to buy 
                    souvenirs on a big holiday weekend.

                    This particular pencil is from Chikan Tower in Tainan. The tower has a storied history, first as a Dutch fort named Fort Provintia. It was rebuilt several times and once acted 
                    as the capital building of the Taiwan island during Dutch colonization. The top level has a commanding view of the area and is the oldest building in the region. The complex itself 
                    contains a number of different sites excluding the actual fort. A pavilion, the Haisheng (Ocean god) temple and the site of a old academy turned hospital during the Japanese occupation.

                    The pencil itself is has the name of Chikan Tower (赤崁樓) and Kuixing Brush (魁星筆) written on the side of it. In the past, Chikan Tower was used to worship the Dragon King of the 
                    Four Seas and Mazu. In particular Kuixing is represented by the 4 stars in the constellation of the Big Dipper that forms the dipper. He is also the god of exams and one of the Five 
                    Gods of Literature! In order to get this pencil, a vistor has to ask a question to Kuixing and have him answer in the affirmative by reading the 
                    <a class="text-slate-200" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaobei">jiao bei</a>. A bit esoteric but a fun experience!

                I thought you might enjoy some of the history of where the pencil came from as well as some of the background on the pineapple cakes!
                Do note that they do not have preservatives so they will go bad pretty quick. Enjoy soon! Till next time!
