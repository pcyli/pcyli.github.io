                    This is the extremely well known version of the pineapple cake from Taiwan. ChiaTe bakery does the original recipe very well and has a well deserved reputation. 
                    The bakery makes a variety of these pineapple cakes from the original (shown here), cherry pineapple, longan, pineapple and egg yolk amongst others.  
                    The original variant of the "pineapple cake" also includes wax gourd. You might have seen it during Lunar New Years when it's candied. This was done because 
                    back in the day the canning and processing of pineapple caused the pastries to taste bad. Sugar and wax gourd were introduced to make it more palatable.

                    You can only get these in specific locations and primarily at their 1 bakery store in Taipei. I, however, ended my trip on a holiday weekend so when 
                    I managed to make my way over there, they were closed. Thankfully they had the originals available at a nearby store knowing idiots like me trying to buy 
                    souvenirs on a big holiday weekend.

                    Both of these varieties come from Dawn Cake bakery in Taichung. If you ever do make it out to Taichung, definitely check out Miyahara. 
                    It's a fantastic spot for you to shop for some of these delicious baked goods! The space itself originally was a ophthalmology clinic during the Japanese colonial period. 
                    The space was subsequently abandoned and fell into disrepair. The bakery bought the space and renovated it to keep the exterior red brick while the inside looks like a modern 
                    cross between Hogwarts and the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. While you're there, hop over next door where they do fantastic

                    The pineapple cakes here (and the next one) are different from ChiaTe in that it contains no wax gourd at all. Due to modern processing and storage methods fresh 
                    pineapple can be distilled into a jam without the historical issues. This causes these pineapple cakes to be more tart and less sweet than the original counterparts.

                <div class="mt-4">
                    If you have the pineapple cake with the pineapple decoration (left), that is the locally sourced from Kaiying. These pineapples are a smaller variety from ones you usually 
                    see stateside. Comparatively, it is a milder pineapple flavor and slightly less sweet but more fragrant.

                <div class="mt-4">
                    If you have the pineapple cake with "十七" written from top to bottom (right), that is made from the Tainong No.17 Golden Diamond pineapple. It's slightly sweeter than the 
                    other locally grown pineapple with stronger pineapple taste.

                    SunnyHills is a newer brand out of Taiwan and does an upmarket version of the new style of pineapple cake (No white gourd). Their claim to fame is the use of a special variety of 
                    pinapples coming from the Bagua mountain, which is known for the number of sunny days (get it?). These pineapple are then simmered into a jam like other newer 
                    variety of pineapple cakes. The pastry itself uses New Zealand grass-fed butter, Japanese flour, and specially sourced eggs without preservatives. So the shelf life 
                    is about 30 days.

                    The cafe space is immaculate and use a lot of wood in the design. You can get some tea here with a pineapple cake and enjoy the space. The pineapple cake itself has a 
                    very good texture owing to the pastry crumb and the consistency of the pineapple jam. Definitely less sweet than other counterparts but much more buttery. Would definitely recommend 
                    some strong green tea for this one.

                    HiWalk (The Chinese name is a bit more interesting as 海邊走走. Translating to "A Stroll by the Ocean", whimsical eh?) is a totally new brand to me before this trip. 
                    It was recommended to me by a couple of friends from Hong Kong. The specialize in egg rolls like you would find in a can in Chinatown. These however aren't the 
                    whimpy fragile things that break into shards the second you look at them. You could probably build a log cabin with these with how thick the walls are. And I mean 
                    THICCCCC.

                    I saw a bunch of different varieties for sale from peanut, sesame, and pork floss to seaweed and tea (tie guan yin) flavored varieties. I never tried any of them so 
                    I went with the original. Pretty good flavor and amazingly still very crisp and layered even though it's been rolled to that thickness. I definitely will try the other 
                    flavors next time I manage to get over there.
